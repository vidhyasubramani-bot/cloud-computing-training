# 🏥 Hospital Web Application Deployment using Docker & Kubernetes

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to containerize and deploy a Python-based Hospital Web Application using Docker and Kubernetes on a Minikube cluster. The application is deployed using Kubernetes resources such as Namespace, Pod, Deployment, Services, Persistent Volume, ConfigMap, and Secret.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* Python (Flask)
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Minikube
* kubectl
* Ubuntu (AWS EC2)

## 📄 File Description

### app.py

* Main Python Flask application.
* Displays the Hospital Web Application.

### Dockerfile

* Creates a Docker image for the Flask application.
* Defines the runtime environment.

### namespace.yml

* Creates a dedicated Kubernetes Namespace.
* Organizes project resources separately.

### pod.yml

* Creates a single Kubernetes Pod to run the application.

### deployment.yml

* Creates and manages application Pods.
* Supports scaling and self-healing.

### clusterip.yml

* Creates an internal ClusterIP Service.
* Allows communication between Pods inside the cluster.

### nodeport.yml

* Exposes the application using a NodePort.
* Makes the application accessible through the Minikube node IP.

### loadbalancer.yml

* Creates a LoadBalancer Service.
* Provides external access (using Minikube Tunnel or cloud provider).

### config.yml

* Creates a ConfigMap.
* Stores application configuration values.

### secret.yml

* Creates Kubernetes Secrets.
* Stores sensitive information like passwords and API keys securely.

### pv.yml

* Creates a Persistent Volume.
* Provides persistent storage for the application.
